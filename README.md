## 5.3 Turn Based Game

One of the most fun things I did in my time at The Iron Yard. The main goal of this project was to practice collaborating with another developer, utilizing git to pull and rebase work from our partner. My awesome teammate and I had a great time with this, since we were both pretty creative. It's a little silly, but we had a great time making it fairly sophisticated for a relatively simple project.
